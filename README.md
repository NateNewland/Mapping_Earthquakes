# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Overview
We were tasked with creating a program that shows earthquake data from around the world using d3 GeoJSON and using multiple layers. We wanted to display the fault lines near the USA and the earthquakes recorded

## Deilverable 1
With my program I made a color coded visual representation of the earthquakes recorded and their magnitudes. This also shows the fault lines and how the earthquakes shape up to them.

## Deliverable 2 & 3
I created multiple layers showing different views of the data to help refine the data we desire.

# Summary
I did run into a few issues with this challenge. I couldn't get my github pages to display the data and program but when ran on my machine I had no issues with the website. If this is an issue I can try to refine the issue and get help through my class and tutors. This project was fun and taught a lot of new information.
